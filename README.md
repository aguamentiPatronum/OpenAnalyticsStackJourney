# 🧭 Open Analytics Stack Journey  
**A 12-Week Exploration in Modern Data Workflows**  
by **Brittany Pierson**

This repository documents a 12-week, one-hour-per-week journey exploring modern, open analytics tools and workflows.  
The goal is to strengthen fluency in data modeling, transformation, visualization, and reproducible analytics delivery using lightweight, open technologies.

Each week builds toward a cohesive example of an open analytics stack — from raw data to dashboard — while practicing documentation and asynchronous collaboration patterns common in distributed data teams.

---

## 🎯 Project Objectives
- Strengthen **SQL and dbt** fluency through applied examples  
- Explore **data modeling** and dimensional design principles  
- Build and document an **end-to-end analytics workflow** using open-source tools  
- Practice **async documentation** and communication in project handoffs  
- Experiment with **dashboard UX design** and **data storytelling** for non-technical users
